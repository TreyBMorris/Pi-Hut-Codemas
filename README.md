# Pi Hut Codemas
This is my following of the PiHut 12 Projects of Codemas and Let it Glow Advent Calendars

I don't like Python, so I decided to use the C/C++ route. I also haven't used C since my Operating Systems class I think, so I wanted to touch up on some of my C skills. Get started [here](https://pip-assets.raspberrypi.com/categories/610-raspberry-pi-pico/documents/RP-008276-DS-1-getting-started-with-pico.pdf?disposition=inline).
[Here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/c_sdk.html#sdk-setup) is the C/C++ SDK so that you can look at API level documentation and whatever else you might need for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
